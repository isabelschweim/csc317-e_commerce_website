            <h3>Fun Fact #1</h3>
            <p>
              Did you know that dinosaurs lived on Earth for about 165 million years? 
              That's longer than humans have been around! And we're just getting started in the world 
              of NFTs, so we plan to stick around for quite a while, too.

            <h3>Fun Fact #2</h3>
            <p>
              We’re not just about coding—we also enjoy discussing which dinosaur would make the 
              best pet. While the T. rex is *pretty cool*, we think a Velociraptor would make an 
              excellent tech support assistant!

            <h3>Fun Fact #3</h3>
            <p>
              Our team occasionally competes to see who can design the most outlandish dinosaur. 
              So if you notice a dino with a mohawk or wearing sunglasses, it might be one of our 
              designs trying to stand out!

            <h3>Fun Fact #4</h3>
            <p>
                While dinosaurs may have gone extinct millions of years ago, their legacy lives on 
                through us—yes, even through NFTs! It’s like they say, “Gone but never forgotten.” 
                Our dinosaurs are digitally immortal!            
            </p>

            <h3>Fun Fact #5</h3>
            <p>
                We might be creating NFTs of dinosaurs, but did you know that some dinosaurs, 
                like the Therizinosaurus, had claws that were longer than a human’s height? 
                That’s one powerful creature—maybe a bit like our future in the NFT world!            
            </p>

        <article>
            <h3>Fun Fact #6</h3>
            <p>
                The word "dinosaur" comes from the Greek words deinos (terrible) and sauros (lizard). 
                But we think our NFTs are pretty “terribly” awesome!
