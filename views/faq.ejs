                Our NFTs are one-of-a-kind and available in limited quantities, 
                making them perfect for collectors. Each design is inspired by the

            <h3>4. What do I need to get started?</h3>
              <p>
                To purchase and store NFTs, you’ll need a digital wallet like 
                MetaMask or Trust Wallet. If you don’t have one yet, setting it up is quick and easy.

                resell or trade it on compatible marketplaces like OpenSea at your discretion.

            <h3>9. Can I buy a dinosaur NFT with pizza?</h3>
              <p>
                Unfortunately, as cool as it would be to trade pizza for NFTs, 
                we can only accept traditional payment methods like credit cards or 
                crypto. But hey, keep an eye on our future updates—who knows what we might accept next?

            <h3>10. What happens if I accidentally buy a dinosaur that isn’t as rare as I thought?</h3>
              <p>
                Don’t worry! All of our dinosaurs are rare in their own way, and each one 
                comes with its own unique charm. But if you want a truly one-of-a-kind 
                dinosaur, check out our limited edition collection—those babies are the rarest of them all!

            <h3>11. Do these dinosaurs come with a warranty?</h3>
              <p>
                We wish we could offer a warranty for these digital creatures, 
                but unfortunately, our dinosaurs are not real—just like the ones 
                in your childhood dreams. However, they’re all backed by blockchain 
                technology, which is pretty much like a warranty for the future!
